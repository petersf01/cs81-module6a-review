# Reflection

# What was the hardest part to understand?
The hardest part to understand was the class.prototype.function syntax. Its different from other languages.

# How does this code use this to tie data and behavior together?
The this references the instance of the object. It allows for multiple instances of the class with differnent values.

# What would you do differently if you wrote this object from scratch?
I would probably add a shuffle method and not have skip remove a song from the array.
